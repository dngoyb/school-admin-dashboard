Please go to docs and only check only backend file and advise me whatis the next step 

I'll help you check the backend documentation. Let me search for backend-related documentation files.
Based on the documentation I've reviewed, I can provide guidance on the next steps for the backend development. According to the backend documentation (docs/backend.md), here are the key next steps you should focus on:
Core Backend Setup:
Ensure you have the basic NestJS application structure set up
Set up your development environment with pnpm
Configure OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation using @nestjs/swagger
Authentication Implementation:
Implement JWT-based authentication
Create the AuthController with these endpoints:
POST /auth/login for user authentication
GET /auth/me for retrieving authenticated user details
Set up JWT verification guards and request context
Core Controllers and Services:
Implement the following controllers as outlined in the documentation:
UsersController (user management)
StudentsController (student management)
AttendanceController (attendance tracking)
AnnouncementsController (announcements)
Database Integration:
Ensure Prisma is properly set up with your PostgreSQL database
Implement multi-tenancy filtering using schoolId
Set up audit logging using Prisma middleware
Security Implementation:
Implement input validation using NestJS pipes and class-validator
Set up authorization guards for role-based access
Configure rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
Ensure proper JWT handling with strong secrets and appropriate expiration times
Testing:
Set up Jest for unit and integration testing
Write tests for your controllers, services, and authentication logic
API Documentation:
Document your REST endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger
Ensure all endpoints are properly documented with request/response schemas
Environment Configuration:
Set up proper environment variables for different environments (development, production)
Configure database connection settings
Set up proper logging
Looking at your current Dockerfile, you already have a good foundation with a multi-stage build process and proper security considerations (non-root user, health checks). The next step would be to focus on implementing the core functionality as outlined above.
Would you like me to provide more detailed guidance on any of these specific areas? For example, I can help you with:
Setting up the authentication system
Implementing specific controllers
Configuring Prisma and database integration
Setting up testing infrastructure
Implementing security measures
Let me know which area you'd like to focus on first!
