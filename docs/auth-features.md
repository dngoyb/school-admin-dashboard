## Technical Considerations

### Email Service
- Need to set up email service (e.g., SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Email templates for verification, password reset, etc.
- Email queue for better performance

### Security
- Rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Secure token storage
- Token encryption
- CSRF protection
- XSS prevention

### Database Updates
- New tables/fields needed:
  - Email verification tokens
  - Password reset tokens
  - Login attempts
  - User sessions
  - Security logs
  - User profile

### Dependencies to Add
- Email service provider
- 2FA library
- Rate limiting
- Session management
- OAuth providers

## Implementation Priority
1. Email verification (critical for security)
2. Password reset (essential for user experience)
3. Profile management (basic user needs)
4. Session management (security)
5. Role & permissions (access control)
6. Audit logging (security & compliance)
7. Social auth (optional)
8. 2FA (optional)

## Notes
- Consider implementing features incrementally
- Each feature should have proper testing
- Document API endpoints as they're added
- Consider security implications of each feature
- Plan for scalability from the start
