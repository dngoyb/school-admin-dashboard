# **Improved Database Plan: School Admin Dashboard (SaaS)**

This document outlines an enhanced plan for the database layer of the School Admin Dashboard as a Service, utilizing PostgreSQL and Prisma, with a focus on best practices, scalability, security, and maintainability.  
**Technology Stack:**

* **Database System:** PostgreSQL  
* **ORM:** Prisma  
* **Local Development Environment:** Docker Compose  
* **Package Manager for Prisma CLI:** pnpm

**1\. Goals and Objectives:**

* Design and implement a highly reliable, scalable, and secure database schema to store all school-related data.  
* Ensure strict data integrity and consistency through appropriate data types, constraints, and relationships defined at both the database and ORM levels.  
* Provide a secure environment for storing sensitive student, staff, and parent information, implementing strong access controls.  
* Utilize Prisma as a type-safe and efficient ORM for database interactions from the backend, leveraging its features for schema management and querying.  
* Establish an easy-to-set-up local development database environment using Docker Compose, including health checks and data persistence.  
* Implement strategies for database growth, performance optimization, high availability, robust security, and effective auditing.

**2\. Technology Choice Rationale (PostgreSQL / Prisma):**

* **PostgreSQL:** Remains an excellent choice due to its reliability, ACID compliance, advanced features (like JSONB, indexing options, and Row-Level Security), and strong community support. It's well-suited for the complex, structured data required by a school administration system.  
* **Prisma:** A modern ORM that provides a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with the database. Its schema-first approach, automated migrations, and powerful query builder streamline database development, reduce errors, and provide excellent type safety when integrated with TypeScript in the backend.

**3\. Database Schema Design (MVP Focus with Enhancements):**  
For the MVP, the database schema will focus on the core entities and their relationships, designed with future expansion and enhanced integrity in mind. We will explicitly define constraints and data types.

* **School Table:** (To support Multi-Tenancy)  
  * id: UUID (Primary Key). Using UUIDs provides a globally unique identifier, simplifying data merging or distribution in the future and preventing ID collisions across schools.  
  * name: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL).  
  * address: TEXT (Optional).  
  * contactEmail: VARCHAR(255) (Optional, consider adding a CHECK constraint for email format).  
  * contactPhone: VARCHAR(50) (Optional).  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()). Store timestamps with time zone for consistency.  
  * updatedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now(), On Update: now()). Automatically update this timestamp on record modification.  
  * *Prisma Schema:* Use @id @default(uuid()) for id, @createdAt, @updatedAt.  
* **User Table:** (For Authentication & Login)  
  * id: UUID (Primary Key).  
  * email: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL, Unique). Add a CHECK constraint for email format.  
  * password: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL \- Hashed). Store password hashes, never plain text.  
  * role: VARCHAR(50) (NOT NULL \- e.g., 'ADMIN', 'TEACHER', 'PARENT', 'STUDENT'). Use a database ENUM type or a VARCHAR with a CHECK constraint against a predefined list of roles for better integrity.  
  * schoolId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing School table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE or ON DELETE RESTRICT based on desired behavior (CASCADE is common if deleting a school should remove associated users, but RESTRICT is safer).  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * updatedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now(), On Update: now()).  
  * isActive: BOOLEAN (NOT NULL, Default: true). Use this for soft deletes or disabling accounts.  
  * *Relationships:* One-to-one (Optional) relationships with Admin, Teacher, Parent, and Student tables, enforced by a unique foreign key constraint on the profile tables referencing userId.  
* **Student Table:** (Core Student Profile Data)  
  * id: UUID (Primary Key).  
  * studentId: VARCHAR(50) (NOT NULL). Implement a **composite Unique Constraint** on (schoolId, studentId) to ensure uniqueness within a school.  
  * firstName: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL).  
  * lastName: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL).  
  * dateOfBirth: DATE (Optional).  
  * gender: VARCHAR(20) (Optional). Use a database ENUM or CHECK constraint.  
  * enrollmentStatus: VARCHAR(50) (NOT NULL, Default: 'ACTIVE'). Use a database ENUM or CHECK constraint.  
  * schoolId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing School table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * userId: UUID (Optional \- Foreign Key referencing User table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint with ON DELETE SET NULL if deleting a user should not delete the student record. Add a UNIQUE constraint on this column if a student can only have one user account linked.  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * updatedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now(), On Update: now()).  
  * isDeleted: BOOLEAN (NOT NULL, Default: false). Implement soft deletes consistently.  
  * *Relationships:* One-to-one (optional) with User, Many-to-many with Class (via Enrollment/StudentClass), Many-to-many with Parent (via StudentParent).  
* **Class Table:**  
  * id: UUID (Primary Key).  
  * name: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL).  
  * academicYear: VARCHAR(50) (NOT NULL \- e.g., "2024-2025"). Consider linking this to a dedicated AcademicYear table later.  
  * schoolId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing School table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * teacherId: UUID (Optional \- Foreign Key referencing Teacher table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint with ON DELETE SET NULL.  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * updatedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now(), On Update: now()).  
  * *Relationships:* Many-to-one with Teacher, Many-to-many with Student (via Enrollment/StudentClass).  
* **Attendance Record Table:**  
  * id: UUID (Primary Key).  
  * date: DATE (NOT NULL).  
  * status: VARCHAR(50) (NOT NULL). Use a database ENUM or CHECK constraint.  
  * sessionId: VARCHAR(50) (Optional \- e.g., "AM", "Period 1").  
  * studentId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing Student table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * classId: UUID (Optional \- Foreign Key referencing Class table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint with ON DELETE SET NULL.  
  * recordedById: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing User table \- who marked attendance). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * schoolId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing School table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * updatedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now(), On Update: now()).  
  * **Unique Constraint:** Implement a composite unique constraint on (studentId, date, sessionId, schoolId) if tracking multiple sessions, or (studentId, date, schoolId) for daily attendance. This is crucial for data integrity.  
  * *Relationships:* Many-to-one with Student, Many-to-one with Class, Many-to-one with User, Many-to-one with School.  
* **Announcement Table:**  
  * id: UUID (Primary Key).  
  * title: VARCHAR(255) (NOT NULL).  
  * content: TEXT (NOT NULL).  
  * publishedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL).  
  * schoolId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing School table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * createdByUserId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing User table \- Admin who created it). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * audience: JSONB (Optional) or a separate linking table. Using JSONB allows flexibility for storing audience details (e.g., list of role IDs, class IDs), but a linking table is more structured for complex audience targeting. For MVP, a simple VARCHAR or TEXT might suffice, but plan for a structured approach.  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * updatedAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now(), On Update: now()).  
  * *Relationships:* Many-to-one with User, Many-to-one with School.

Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE (if deleting the user should remove the teacher profile) or ON DELETE RESTRICT.  
  * employeeId: VARCHAR(50) (Optional). Implement a **composite Unique Constraint** on (schoolId, employeeId) if used.

  * *Composite Primary Key:* (studentId, parentId, schoolId). This ensures a unique link between a student, parent, and school.  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * *Relationships:* Many-to-one with Student, Many-to-one with Parent, Many-to-one with School.  
* **Enrollment / StudentClass Table:** (Join table for Many-to-Many relationship between Student and Class)

  * classId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing Class table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * schoolId: UUID (NOT NULL \- Foreign Key referencing School table). Add a database-level FOREIGN KEY constraint.  
  * enrollmentDate: DATE (Optional).  
  * completionDate: DATE (Optional).  
  * *Composite Primary Key:* (studentId, classId, schoolId). This ensures a unique enrollment per student, class, and school.  
  * createdAt: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (NOT NULL, Default: now()).  
  * *Relationships:* Many-to-one with Student, Many-to-one with Class, Many-to-one with School.

**6\. Data Types and Constraints:**

* **UUIDs for Primary Keys:** Consistent use of UUIDs simplifies multi-tenancy management and future horizontal scaling.  
* **TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE:** Use for all timestamp fields to avoid ambiguity.  
* **DATE:** Use for date-only fields like birthdays.  
* **NUMERIC:** Use for currency and precise numerical values to avoid floating-point issues. Specify precision and scale (e.g., NUMERIC(10, 2\) for currency).  
* **VARCHAR with Length Limits:** Specify appropriate lengths for strings (VARCHAR(255), VARCHAR(50)) to manage storage and hint at data expectations. Use TEXT for longer content like descriptions.  
* **Database ENUMs or CHECK Constraints:** Prefer database-level ENUMs or CHECK constraints for columns with a limited set of possible values (roles, statuses, types) for stricter data integrity enforced by the database itself. Prisma supports mapping to PostgreSQL ENUMs.  
* **NOT NULL Constraints:** Apply NOT NULL to all columns that must contain a value.  
* **Unique Constraints:** Apply unique constraints (UNIQUE or composite UNIQUE) where data must be unique (e.g., email, studentId within a school, invoiceNumber within a school).  
* **Foreign Key Constraints:** Define FOREIGN KEY constraints at the database level for all relationships. Specify ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions (CASCADE, RESTRICT, SET NULL, NO ACTION) based on how you want the database to behave when linked records are modified or deleted.

**7\. Indexing:**

* Automatically generated indexes on Primary Keys and Unique Constraints.  
* **Crucially, add indexes on all Foreign Key columns.** This is vital for query performance when joining tables.  
* Add indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or ORDER BY clauses (e.g., User.email, Student.lastName, AttendanceRecord.date).  
* Consider **composite indexes** for columns frequently queried together (e.g., on (schoolId, status) for filtering students by status within a school).  
* Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE in PostgreSQL to understand query plans and identify missing indexes.

**8\. Multi-Tenancy Implementation (Row-Level Security \- RLS):**

* While the schoolId column is necessary in every tenant-specific table, relying solely on application-level filtering (WHERE schoolId \= ...) is prone to errors and security vulnerabilities if a filter is missed.  
* **Strongly recommend implementing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS).** RLS allows you to define policies that automatically filter data based on the connected user's role or session variables (like the schoolId extracted from the JWT in your backend). This enforces multi-tenancy at the database level, providing a much stronger security guarantee and simplifying application code.  
* Prisma supports working with RLS, often by setting session variables before executing queries.

**9\. Auditing:**

* The AuditLog table is a good start.  
* **Implementation Strategy:** The most common approach with Prisma is to use **Prisma Middleware**. You can write middleware that intercepts create, update, and delete operations on sensitive models and automatically logs the changes to the AuditLog table, including the user ID and the old/new data (using JSONB).

**10\. Soft Deletes:**

* Implement a consistent soft-delete strategy using an isDeleted boolean column (defaulting to false) on all tables where data should not be permanently removed (Users, Students, Teachers, Parents, etc.).  
* Modify your application queries to exclude soft-deleted records by default (WHERE isDeleted \= false).  
* Consider adding a unique index constraint that includes the isDeleted column to allow "re-creating" a soft-deleted record with the same unique identifier (e.g., UNIQUE (schoolId, studentId, isDeleted) where isDeleted is false).

**11\. Prisma Best Practices:**

* **Schema as Source of Truth:** Treat your schema.prisma file as the single source of truth for your database schema.  
* **Prisma Migrate:** Use Prisma Migrate for all schema changes. This generates migration files that track your schema evolution and allow you to apply changes reliably.  
* **Model Naming:** Use singular names for models (e.g., User, Student).  
* **Field Naming:** Use camelCase for field names in the Prisma schema, which maps to snake\_case in the PostgreSQL database by default (or use @@map for explicit mapping).  
* **Relations:** Define relationships clearly in the Prisma schema using the @@relation attribute where needed.  
* **Indexes and Constraints:** Define indexes (@@index) and unique constraints (@@unique) directly in the Prisma schema.

**12\. Scalability and Performance:**

* **Connection Pooling:** Use a connection pooler (like PgBouncer) in production to efficiently manage database connections from your backend application. Prisma Client has built-in connection pooling, but for high-concurrency scenarios, a separate pooler can be beneficial.  
* **Database Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive database monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus and Grafana) to track query performance, resource usage, and identify bottlenecks.  
* **Read Replicas:** For read-heavy workloads, consider setting up PostgreSQL read replicas to distribute read traffic.  
* **Sharding/Partitioning:** As the database grows very large, explore database partitioning (built into PostgreSQL) or sharding strategies, although this adds significant complexity and should only be considered when necessary.  
* **Optimize Queries:** Continuously review and optimize your database queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE.

**13\. Backup and Recovery:**

* Implement a regular backup strategy for your PostgreSQL database.  
* Store backups securely and offsite.  
* Regularly test your recovery process to ensure you can restore the database from backups.

**14\. Security:**

* **Strong Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies for database users.  
* **Least Privilege:** Grant database users only the necessary privileges. Your backend application user should not have superuser privileges.  
* **Encryption:** Use SSL/TLS to encrypt connections between your application and the database. Consider encrypting sensitive data at rest using PostgreSQL's encryption features or application-level encryption for extremely sensitive fields.  
* **Regular Updates:** Keep PostgreSQL and Prisma updated to patch security vulnerabilities.  
* **Audit Logs:** Utilize the audit log for security monitoring and incident response.

**15\. Local Development Environment (Docker Compose):**  
Your docker-compose.yml is a good start.

* **Stick to a Specific Version:** As noted, specify a precise PostgreSQL version (e.g., postgres:13.14) rather than just postgres:13 to ensure consistency.  
* **Health Check:** The health check is important to ensure the database is ready before the backend tries to connect.  
* **Data Persistence:** The volume mount is essential for persisting data between container restarts.  
* **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration (user, password, db name).
